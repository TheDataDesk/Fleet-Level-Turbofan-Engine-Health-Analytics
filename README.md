## Project Overview

Jet engine reliability is critical for aerospace operations.
This project builds an analytics pipeline that ingests, processes, and interprets sensor data from a fleet of simulated turbofan engines to derive health metrics, early degradation signals, and visual dashboards. This demonstrates data engineering, analytics, and visualization skills relevant to roles in Aerospace.

## About the Dataset 

NASA C-MAPSS Jet Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset
Source: https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/cmapss-jet-engine-simulated-data

The dataset simulates multiple engine units over time (cycles), capturing sensor readings and operational settings. Each unit runs until failure, providing a realistic view of degradation patterns for fleet analytics and predictive modeling.

## Objectives

- Ingest raw time-series sensor data for multiple engine units.

- Clean & validate the dataset for missing values or abnormal readings.

- Generate analytical metrics that represent engine health over time.

- Build visualizations to explore degradation trends at the fleet and engine-level.

- Provide insights that could inform maintenance planning or anomaly investigation.
